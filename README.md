•	OBJECTIVE
---------------------------


To solve the issue stated in the previous slide, this project has two parts basically-Location Tracking and Health Monitoring. The system will be useful for monitoring patient’s location using GPS. 

The second part of the system which will contain the health monitoring system will be able to track the patient’s pulse rate and using the GSM Module all the information can be shared through SMS service to the desired phone number. 
Density of COVID-19 cases in India are one of the highest across the world. Using advance wireless technology of GPS, it is possible to provide medical facility to COVID-19 victim within short period of time. On the other hand, where the patient’s family members have no contact with the patient, they will be able to track their beloved family member’s health and location. 
It will also become more convenient for the hospital to track down the health of all the patients’ health data through a single monitor when they scale the project.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has given a major blow to the medical system of our country and the world. India has witnessed over 1.1 Crore cases of COVID-19 and caused over 1.57 Lac deaths. As per various journals and newspaper articles a lot of causalities could have been avoided if our medical system would have been more equipped and the infected patient’s health could have been monitored in a more efficient way. Design a system which will help in monitoring a patient’s basic medical condition and track their location in an efficient way.
